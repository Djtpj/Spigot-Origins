# Spigot Origins
A fun port of the classic mod to Spigot! (With some slight changes of course)

# Contributing
Spigot Origins was designed with the intent of having a community of contributors and developers. If you have an idea for an Origin, feel free to submit an Origin request in the Issues tab. 

If you do not have an idea but still want to contribute, help someone else bring their idea to reality! The wiki is full of tutorials and examples of how to create new Origins!
